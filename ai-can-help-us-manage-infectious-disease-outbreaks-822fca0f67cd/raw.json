Unfortunately, Coronavirus has been the center of conversation instead of the various celebrations that are going on in Chinatowns all over the world. Coronavirus is a contagious virus that affects the respiratory tract of mammals including humans. There’s currently no treatment or cure available. The virus can also mutate. The mutation can make the virus more transmittable. This can lead to difficulties in managing the epidemic.",
