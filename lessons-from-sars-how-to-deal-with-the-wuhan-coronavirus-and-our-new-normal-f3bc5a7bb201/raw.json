  "text": "It was the spring of SARS. The outbreak, which had originated in late 2002 across the border in the neighboring Chinese province of Guangdong, had been growing throughout the month. In Hong Kong, where I had been working as a reporter for TIME magazine for nearly two years, there had been a burst of cases at one of the city’s main hospitals. There were smaller outbreaks in cities like Singapore, Taipei, Beijing, and Toronto. By the middle of the month, the World Health Organization (WHO) had issued a heightened global health alert over the respiratory illness, which didn’t yet have an official name. Worst of all, on March 30 an explosive outbreak in Hong Kong’s Amoy Gardens apartment complex sickened more than 200 people and fueled fears that the SARS virus — which up until then had mostly spread in health care settings — was now active in the community. And if the SARS virus could spread easily in public through the air like the flu, what could stop it? Which is how I found myself on that couch, worrying I was going to die in Hong Kong.",
  "translation": "那是SARS的春天。疫情始于2002年底，跨越邻近的中国广东省边境，整个月一直在增长。在香港，我曾在《时代》杂志担任记者近两年，在香港的一家主要医院里爆发了很多病例。在新加坡，台北，北京和多伦多等城市，疫情较小。到本月中旬，世界卫生组织（WHO）发出了关于呼吸系统疾病的全球性健康警报，该警报尚未正式名称。最糟糕的是，3月30日，香港淘花园公寓大楼内发生的爆炸性暴发使200多人患病，并加剧了人们对SARS病毒的担忧，SARS病毒直到现在主要在医疗机构中传播，现在正在社区中活跃起来。而且，如果SARS病毒像流感一样可以很容易地在空中传播，那么有什么办法可以阻止它呢？这就是我在沙发上发现自己的方式，担心自己要在香港去世。"

  "text": "Looking back 17 years later, I can see those fears for what they were: ridiculous. The Amoy Gardens outbreak, which marked the high point of SARS hysteria, turned out to be the result of a fluky set of epidemiological coincidences that hinged on the apartment complex’s faulty plumbing system. There was never again a large-scale community outbreak of SARS on that scale. A couple of weeks later international scientists managed to isolate and identify the pathogen that was causing SARS, and I found myself at Hong Kong’s Queen Mary Hospital, staring through an electron microscope at the spiky coronavirus that was the cause of all this trouble. By the end of April, the outbreak was halted in a number of affected cities and the number of new cases in Hong Kong was plummeting fast. By July 5, the WHO declared the SARS outbreak contained. It was all over.",
  "translation": "回顾17年后，我可以看到那些恐惧的恐惧：荒谬。 淘大花园的爆发标志着SARS歇斯底里的高潮，事实证明这是一系列流行病学巧合的结果，这些巧合取决于公寓大楼故障的管道系统。 如此大规模的SARS社区再也没有爆发。 几周后，国际科学家设法隔离并鉴定出导致SARS的病原体。我发现自己住在香港的玛丽医院，通过电子显微镜盯着尖刺的冠状病毒，这是造成所有此类麻烦的原因。 到4月底，疫情在许多受影响的城市中止，并且香港的新病例急剧下降。 到7月5日，世卫组织宣布已控制SARS爆发。 一切都结束了。"

  "text": "SARS has obvious parallels to the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, and not just because both originated in China and were caused by pathogens of the same viral family. The differences matter too, from the nature and virulence of the virus to the major technological and geopolitical changes that have occurred since 2003. But perhaps the most important lesson — as the Wuhan outbreak exceeds the total number of SARS cases and the WHO finally declares the situation a global health emergency — is this: An outbreak looks and feels very differently as it is unfolding than it does in hindsight, when the cases have been closed and the virus contained. Which should give us some comfort as global alarm rises over the new coronavirus, while also reminding us of just how hard it is to know what will come next.",
  "translation": "SARS与正在进行的武汉冠状病毒爆发有明显的相似之处，而不仅仅是因为它们都起源于中国并且是由同一病毒家族的病原体引起的。 从病毒的性质和毒力到2003年以来发生的重大技术和地缘政治变化，差异也很重要。但也许最重要的一课-武汉的暴发超过了SARS病例的总数，WHO最终宣布 情况是全球卫生紧急情况–是这样：爆发事件在外观和感觉上与发生事后看来和发生事后截然不同，当时案件已经结案并包含病毒。 随着全球对新冠状病毒的警惕不断上升，这应该给我们带来一些安慰，同时也使我们想起下一步将要面临的困难。"

  "text": "The reason why the Amoy Gardens outbreak was so frightening was that it seemed to mark a drastic shift in just how contagious the SARS virus was. SARS already appeared, true to its name, severe. At the time nearly 60 people had died from SARS, out of more than 1,600 cases, but even those who survived were often hospitalized for weeks, with many requiring mechanical ventilation to breathe (a treatment that inadvertently helped spread the disease in hospitals before doctors realized what they were dealing with). If SARS could spread easily among the public, as the Amoy outbreak seemed to indicate, the effects would be truly devastating. Think hospitals overwhelmed by patients gasping for breath, requiring the rationing of ventilators and forms of emergency care. Hence the fear.",
  "translation": "淘大花园爆发之所以如此可怕，是因为它标志着SARS病毒的传染性发生了巨大变化。 顾名思义，SARS已经出现了。 当时，在1,600多例病例中，有将近60人死于SARS，但即使是幸存者，也常常要住院数周，其中许多患者需要机械通气来呼吸（这种治疗在医生意识到之前无意中帮助了疾病的传播） 他们正在处理什么）。 如果SARS能够像淘气爆发所表明的那样在公众中轻松传播，那么后果将是真正的破坏性的。 认为医院不堪重负，因为病人喘着粗气喘口气，需要配给呼吸机和形式的急救服务。 因此恐惧。"

  "text": "Unlike SARS, the Wuhan coronavirus — or 2019-nCoV as its officially called, for 2019 novel coronavirus — seems to have been fairly contagious in public from the earliest stages of the outbreak, which is why the case numbers have piled up so quickly. But like SARS, in the middle stages of that outbreak, we don’t really know how contagious the new coronavirus is yet. As science writer Ed Yong pointed out in an excellent article in The Atlantic, scientists have come up with a range of figures for the virus’s infectivity, characterized as its R0 — the average number of people each infected person will in turn infect. The higher the R0 — and most early estimates for the new coronavirus fall between 2 and 3 which is theoretically the more contagious a pathogen will be and the more difficult it will be to control an outbreak. But R0 is an average that can hide all kinds of variation, including the possibility that some sick individuals may infect large numbers of people, while the vast majority infect very few.",
  "translation": "与SARS不同，武汉冠状病毒（或正式命名为2019-nCoV的2019年新型冠状病毒）从疫情爆发的最早阶段就似乎在公众中具有传染性，这就是为什么病例数如此迅速堆积的原因。但是，就像SARS一样，在疫情爆发的中期，我们还真的不知道新的冠状病毒是否具有传染性。正如科学作家爱德·勇（Ed Yong）在《大西洋》上的一篇出色文章中指出的那样，科学家们提出了一系列有关该病毒感染性的数据，以其R0为特征-每个感染者平均将感染的人数。 R0越高，新冠状病毒的早期估计就在2到3之间，从理论上讲，病原体的传染性越强，控制爆发的难度就越大。但是R0是可以掩盖各种变异的平均值，包括某些患病个体可能感染大量人的可能性，而绝大多数人感染的可能性很小。"

  "text": "Such people, known as super-spreaders, played an important role in the SARS outbreak — though again, that wasn’t something we knew for sure in the middle of it. Though SARS ultimately had an R0 around the same range as the early estimates for the new coronavirus, that number was inflated by super-spreaders like Liu Jianlun, a doctor from Guangdong who introduced SARS to Hong Kong in late February when he infected over a dozen people at the city’s Metropole Hotel. Had every SARS patient been as infectious as Liu, community explosions like what happened at Amoy Gardens would have been far more common, and the outbreak might have been impossible to fully contain. But they weren’t, especially once doctors put in place infection control methods that essentially halted transmission in hospitals, which reduced the virus’s R0 number below 1. Ultimately, save for the super-spreaders and flukes like Amoy Gardens, SARS wasn’t a terribly transmissible virus — though again, that wasn’t clear until the later stages of the outbreak.",
  "translation": "这些人被称为超级传播者，在SARS爆发中发挥了重要作用-尽管同样，我们在中间还不确定。尽管SARS最终的R0值与新冠状病毒的早期估计值相近，但该数字被诸如刘建伦的超级传播者夸大了。刘建伦是广东省的医生，他于2月下旬将SARS引入香港，当时他感染了十几个人们在城市的大都会酒店。如果每位SARS病人都像刘一样具有传染性，那么像在淘大花园发生的社区爆炸事件将更加普遍，爆发可能无法完全遏制。但事实并非如此，特别是一旦医生采取了能够基本阻止医院传播的感染控制方法，从而将病毒的R0值降低到1以下。最终，除了像Amoy Gardens这样的超级传播者和骗子，SARS并不是极度可传播的病毒-尽管再次出现，但直到爆发的后期才清楚。"

  "text": "What about the new coronavirus? The picture is incomplete, but less encouraging. The sheer number of cases that have piled up in a fairly short period of time would seem to indicate that the virus spreads more easily in the community than SARS did. On January 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first case of person-to-person spread inside the United States, as a person who had been in Wuhan and returned to Chicago transmitted the virus to another individual. It likely won’t be the last. And while the new coronavirus has racked up almost as many cases in several weeks as SARS did over the course of more than six months, doctors are almost certainly overlooking milder cases in the heat of the outbreak, which means the true case count is likely higher. “If it gets so expansive then it’s not going to just disappear the way SARS did,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, and the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a podcast posted by the medical journal JAMA. “I think the next four to five weeks are going to be critical. It’s either going to start peaking and go into a downturn, or it’s going to explode into a global outbreak.”",
  "translation": "新的冠状病毒呢？图片不完整，但不太令人鼓舞。在相当短的时间内堆积的病例数量之多似乎表明该病毒在社区中的传播比SARS更容易传播。 1月30日，疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）确认了第一例人与人之间在美国境内传播的病例，因为一个人曾在武汉并返回芝加哥，并将该病毒传播给另一个人。可能不会是最后一个。尽管在六个多月的时间里，新的冠状病毒在数周内与SARS的病例数几乎一样，但在爆发期间，医生几乎可以肯定病情较轻，这意味着实际病例数可能更高。美国国家过敏和传染病研究所所长安东尼·福西（Anthony Fauci）博士在医学杂志《美国医学会杂志》（JAMA）发表的播客中说：“如果它变得如此广泛，那么它就不会像SARS一样消失。” “我认为接下来的四到五周至关重要。它要么开始达到顶峰，然后进入衰退，要么爆发到全球爆发。”"

  "text": "The infectivity of a virus helps determine how widespread an outbreak will become, but just as important is how deadly it is. And the early indications are that the new coronavirus is milder for those who contract it then SARS was. With 170 deaths out of around 7,770 confirmed cases as of January 30, the new virus has a mortality rate below 3%. That’s high for a respiratory virus — seasonal flu kills around 0.1% of those it sickens — but it’s lower than the roughly 10% seen during SARS. And while again, any estimate made during the midst of an outbreak is uncertain, it’s more likely that number falls than rises, as doctors uncover milder cases that were initially missed. Those who have died have been elderly and/or suffer from preexisting health problems — the same population that tends to be most vulnerable to the flu.",
  "translation": "病毒的传染性有助于确定爆发的广泛程度，但致命程度也同样重要。 早期迹象表明，与冠状病毒感染者相比，新的冠状病毒要轻于SARS。 截至1月30日，在约7,770例确诊病例中有170例死亡，新病毒的死亡率低于3％。 对于呼吸道病毒来说，这是很高的—季节性流感可杀死约0.1％的致病病毒，但低于SARS期间的10％。 而且，尽管在爆发期间做出的任何估计都不确定，但是随着医生发现最初遗漏的较轻的病例，该数字下降的可能性大于上升的可能性。 那些死者已经年老和/或患有先前存在的健康问题-往往最容易感染流感的人群。"

Advances in genomics helped scientists rapidly sequence the genetic structure of the new coronavirus, which in turn sped the development of diagnostic tests and candidate vaccine strains, even as the outbreak is still at full tilt. It took months after the SARS outbreak officially began before the virus was isolated and sequenced. The Chinese government has been, if far from perfect in how it has handled the new coronavirus, more open than it was during SARS when months of cover-ups on the local level directly led to the virus spreading into Hong Kong and then globally.",

China is far more connected to the rest of the world via travel and business links than it was 17 years ago, which means both that it’s easier for the new coronavirus to spread internationally and that any economic damage in China from the outbreak won’t be contained there. China under President Xi Jinping is even more authoritarian than it was in 2003, increasing the chances that ordinary citizens could be hurt as the government institutes unprecedented responses like the effective quarantining of tens of millions of people in and around the heart of the outbreak. In 2003, brave Chinese citizens like Dr. Jiang Yanyong spoke out against the government’s cover-up. Jiang told my colleagues at TIME’s Beijing office that Chinese officials were hiding SARS patients from the WHO, in an effort to minimize the scale of the outbreak. Instead of being lionized, though, he’s been in and out of house arrest in the years since, and it’s difficult to imagine someone making the same choices to speak up today in Xi’s China.",

Influencers and hucksters have used social media to spread hoaxes about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak, its severity, even supposed treatments.
