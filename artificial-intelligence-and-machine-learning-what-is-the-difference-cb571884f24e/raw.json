This creates some confusion about the fact that many people associate AI with independent thinking. Nevertheless, from the definition of machine learning, it follows that this is an action that a person could perform, and it requires a certain level of intelligence. Perhaps these actions do not need a high level of intelligence, but they fall under the definition of AI.",
