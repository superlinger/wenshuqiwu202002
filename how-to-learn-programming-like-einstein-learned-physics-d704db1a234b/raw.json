Do not simply accept that Rails is a great framework for rapidly developing web applications — learn how Rails works, behind the curtains. Moreover, consider the possibility of contributing to and improving it, as it is open source.",

Of course, we all need money to pay our bills and buy food for ourselves and/or our family, but if you want to excel in software development, you need to cultivate a passion for learning and developing for the sake of it. You need to love programming and feel grateful that you have the opportunity to positively impact the lives of millions of people with the lines of code that you write.",
